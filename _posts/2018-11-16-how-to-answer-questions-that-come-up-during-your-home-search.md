As a homebuyer, there are a few all-important questions you’ll need to ask during your search.&nbsp;

Thankfully, here in the state of Arizona, it is required that every buyer is provided with the Buyer Advisory. This digital document is an incredible resource, and it contains a number of live links to websites that will help you answer many, if not all, of the questions you might have about buying a home.&nbsp;

**The Buyer Advisory can help you find out what an area’s crime statistics are, what local school ratings are, and much more.&nbsp;**

In addition to this resource, though, our team likes to recommend that buyers also follow a couple of other steps when considering a certain home. For example, visiting a given property at various times of day and at different points in the week will help you understand what to expect from the neighborhood on a more comprehensive level.&nbsp;

Following this advice will give you an idea of how much traffic an area receives, how many people park in the street, how loud or quiet the area tends to be, and more. Visiting a neighborhood during the evening or on a weekend will also give you a better idea of how many kids live nearby. If you have children of your own and are looking for a family-friendly area, this may be an important point to consider.

Moving on, **another important question for buyers to ask is how much the home’s monthly utility costs are, on average.** This information can easily be found by contacting SRP, APS, or whatever utility carrier the specific home uses and asking them about the highest and lowest charges associated with that particular property.&nbsp;

The seller may also be willing to share old utility bills, as well. If you ask them to share these, though, remember that they may have different heat preferences, they may be charged on an average, or they may have been grandfathered into an old plan. In other words, take bills you see from the seller with a grain of salt.&nbsp;

Speaking of energy-related expenses, buyers should also remember to ask the seller about the age of the home’s major appliances, as this can significantly impact how much they cost to run. **Some of this information, as well as other relevant points, will be detailed in the Seller Property Disclosure Form.&nbsp;**

This document will also include information about various structural, mechanical, or electrical features throughout the home. However, if any such information is omitted from this document due to a gap in the seller’s knowledge about the property, don’t worry. The inspection process is designed to uncover and inform you of any potential issues.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
