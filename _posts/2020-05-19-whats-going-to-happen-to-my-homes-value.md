<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Will home values drop? Tried-and-true market principles say ‘no.’</em></p>

To get a better understanding of what the future holds for home values in our market, we need to dip into a brief overview of economics and the applicable economic formula. Basically, a market is always categorized by the relationship between supply and demand that exists within it; **for the past several years, our market has had very, very low inventory, and very high demand, making it a seller’s market.** Prior to COVID-19, these conditions led to housing prices rising fairly quickly year after year.&nbsp;

Now, if you’re wondering whether such an imbalance between supply and demand is sustainable, you’re on the right track—no market can climb forever. However, the big fear is that home values would climb so high in such a short period that eventually the market would have to come crashing back down. Well, I have important news for you: **The market is*****not *****going to come crashing down around us amid COVID-19.&nbsp;**

**Right now, our inventory is still very low, yet the demand for it is still high.** A few months ago, we saw homes generate seven to 10 offers and sell for well over asking price, whereas now, multiple offers persist but to a lesser extent—maybe two or three on one home—and homes are selling a little closer to asking price. Demand may have decreased slightly overall, but when viewed in relation to the supply in our market, demand is still high.

When supply drops and the demand drops in like measure, it causes the market to maintain, and home values are preserved. When supply is low and the demand is high, home values go up. **In an inverted scenario where supply is high but the demand is low,*****that’s *****when home values fall.&nbsp;**

Right now, some of you are experiencing difficulties in your life; unfortunately, that is to be expected during these strange and unprecedented times. However, this situation will not be like the 2007 to 2008 real estate crash. The main difference between now and then is that you (and more than half of all homeowners in America) have equity in your home; you have something of value, which gives you options when difficult economic conditions occur. You could take out an equity line of credit; you could refinance to pull money out of your home; you could sell that home to downsize and pay off debts—**you have power when you have equity.&nbsp;**

There are some other options that exist for struggling homeowners right now, the first of which is forbearance. Now, forbearance may be the best route for some people to take, but know that this option comes with long-term damage. I’d love for you to check out the video I previously recorded about the pros and perils of forbearance so that you can get a better understanding of it.&nbsp;

Homeowners also have the option of a short sale. Essentially, short sales occur when there’s not enough equity in your house and there’s a dire need to [sell](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/real-estate-short-sale.asp); thankfully, not very many of you will fall into this category at this time.&nbsp;

Of course, foreclosure is another option for homeowners, but again, **there’s really no need to be considering foreclosures or short sales if you have equity in your home.** That’s what separates this health crisis from the housing crisis of 2008: The overwhelming majority of homeowners aren’t having to endure foreclosures or short sales because they have better options available to them.&nbsp;
