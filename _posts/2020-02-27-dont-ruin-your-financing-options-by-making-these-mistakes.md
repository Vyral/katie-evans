Today, Corey Martens from Academy Mortgage joins me to talk about the biggest mistakes we’ve seen buyers make and why you need to avoid them.

**1\. Making large withdrawals without talking to your lender.** Always consult with your lender before withdrawing large sums of “extra” money. You not only have to be concerned about the down payment and closing costs but also unforeseen payments. Even on the day that you close on the home, you still have to show that you have enough money to make house payments from there onward.

**2\. Making large deposits without consulting your lender.** Anytime a large sum of money is deposited into your account, your lender needs to be able to account for and document its source. If a deposit is something disallowed by your lender’s guidelines, then they’ll have to deduct it from how much is counted in your account, which could cost you the deal. Lenders have more issues with large deposits than they do with large withdrawals.

**3\. Trying to correct your own mistakes.** If you deposited a large sum of undocumented money, only to realize that was a mistake, and then transferred those funds to a different account or withdrew it again, that can also hurt you. Not only could the lender not account for that money, but they’d also have to deduct it from what your balance is and you wouldn’t be able to put it back. You’ll only have dug yourself a deeper hole.

Corey recommends that you first **ask your lender for a list of what to do and what not to do**, then keep it somewhere as a reminder to yourself. A good rule of thumb is to consult with your lender before doing anything out of the ordinary with your money, including accepting gift money, paying off a debt, or making a large-scale purchase like a car or new furniture. Just talking to your lender before making those decisions could potentially save your home purchase.

If you have any additional questions about these or other potential home-buying mistakes, you can call or text Corey at (406) 314-0962. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out to the Living 48 Real Estate Team for any other real estate questions you have. We’d love to hear from you.
