Inventory is tight, and that means buyers like you will be faced with multiple-offer situations at every turn. Here are just two of the many strategies we employ to help our buyers stand out:&nbsp;

**1\. Escalation clause.** This strategy needs to be used with care. We basically tell the seller that we’re willing to increase our offer on their home up to a certain dollar point, beating out the next highest offer by, say, a thousand dollars. But there’s a catch: We’ll increase on the condition that the seller shows us that other offer, so we can be sure it actually existed in the first place and wasn’t the seller’s fabrication. You need to have an experienced agent pull this off, but it’s an excellent tool in our arsenal.&nbsp;

**2\. Write a “love letter” to sellers.** Though pulling on the heartstrings won’t work on every seller, it has been really successful for us in the past. We’ll ask you to send in a picture of yourself and/or your family, along with a written letter telling a little bit about yourself. The key is to then include all of the things you love about the seller’s property.&nbsp;

We’ll send that letter to them along with your offer—which will be the best, cleanest offer that we can write—and hope that the sentimental touch makes you stand out. Keep in mind that your letter will also be complemented by my own, which will detail my team’s professionalism and stellar track record. As if that’s not enough, that seller will also receive a phone call from your lender, telling them how qualified you are. This complete package will come across as incredibly thoughtful.&nbsp;

If you want to know more ways we help buyers succeed or if you have any other real estate questions, reach out to us by phone or email. We’re always here to help.
