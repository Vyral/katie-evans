Instead of waiting until after the holidays to buy or sell a home, why not do it now? There are four surprisingly smart reasons why the holiday season is a great time to pursue your real estate goals, and today we’ll be going over each one:&nbsp;

**1. Less competition.** Traditionally, we see the most homebuyers during the spring and summer seasons. However, these aren’t necessarily great times for you to jump in as a buyer or seller. Buyers will wind up competing in bidding wars with many others who are looking to buy, and sellers will face increased competition, as well. Buying or selling now, means you won’t have to deal with all the competition that comes after the new year.<br><br>**2. Sellers are more motivated.** Whether they’ve listed early in the fall and are frustrated that their home hasn’t sold or they need to sell their home to relocate, sellers are more eager to find buyers. As a result, we find that sellers are more motivated now compared to those in spring and summer.&nbsp;

**3. You can get a better idea of the home.** It’s during this season that you’re more likely to see a home at its worst, which is one reason why sellers wait to list. You’ll be able to see how bad the falling leaves are and get a better idea of what you’ll be dealing with in terms of yard maintenance. In spring and summer, you may be fooled by manicured lawns and blooming flowers. During the holidays, you get the whole picture.<br><br>**4. You will have more access to professional services.** It’s easier to find home inspectors, mortgage lenders, and related service providers during the holiday season. Since there’s not as much real estate activity taking place this time of year, you have the luxury of having better access to these professionals. This is perhaps the most significant reason to buy or sell during this time of year.&nbsp;

We hope you have a happy holiday season, and if you have any questions or would like some more information, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you.<br>&nbsp;
