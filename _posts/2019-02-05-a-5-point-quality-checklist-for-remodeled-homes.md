When you search the market for remodeled homes, what can you do to distinguish a spectacular flip from a spectacular flop?&nbsp;

The first thing you need to do is order a home inspection from an experienced expert, but, after that, there are five main factors to consider:&nbsp;

**1. Are the major systems in working order?** If the hot water heater, air conditioning, and other basic systems and appliances are all in good shape, this bodes well for the rest of the house.&nbsp;<br><br>**2. Does the kitchen look good?** Kitchen remodels are not an easy task. Therefore, it’s a good idea to ensure you’re happy with the room as it is before you make the move to buy.

**3. Was attention paid to the details in the bathroom?** Similarly to kitchen remodels, bathroom remodels can make or break a home. Beautiful countertops and freshly painted walls are great, but you should also pay attention to fine details, like whether the areas around showers or tubs have been properly caulked.&nbsp;<br><br>**4. Is the flooring level and well done?** What is the home’s flooring made of, and was it installed properly? These kinds of questions are of critical importance as you consider a remodeled home.<br><br>**5. Are the finishes pristine?** The devil’s in the details. A truly spectacular home will look just as good up close as it does while standing back.&nbsp;
