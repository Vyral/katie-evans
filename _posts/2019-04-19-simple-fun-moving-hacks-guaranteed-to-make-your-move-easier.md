Sharing life hacks is one of my favorite subjects, so today I’m excited to share a few moving hacks that will make your move much easier.&nbsp;

First, **remember that snacks are hacks, too.** For example, that Pringles can isn’t just for storing tasty chips—it’s also a perfect container for transporting random junk drawer items like pencils and pens.&nbsp;

Second, **use your rubber bands to avoid catastrophe.** Imagine you’re moving into your new house when, all of a sudden, the front door accidentally closes, you’re locked out, and you have to search frantically for your keys and wonder whether you’re going to have to call a locksmith.

Luckily, if you have just one rubber band handy, you don’t have to worry about that kind of thing, because there’s a way you can fasten it to the door to keep it from closing. Refer to the video above at 1:20 to see how this hack works.&nbsp;

Lastly, **“plate it up.”** When you’re packing up your kitchen, you know full well that if you don’t pack your plates correctly, some of them are going to break. One way to make sure they’re safe and snug for the move is to buy those specialized foam moving squares and place each one between your plates as you box them up. That, however, can get expensive.

You can also use your dish towels to achieve the same purpose, but who has enough dish towels for that?

An easier, cheaper alternative is to go to the grocery store and buy a box of disposable styrofoam plates. Not only will this keep your fancy plates safe and sound, but you’ll have plenty of plates ready to eat off of without having to worry about doing the dishes after the moving is done.&nbsp;

If you’d like to know about other moving hacks you can try or if you have any other real estate topics you’d like me to address, feel free to call or email me. I’d be happy to help you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
