Christmas season is in full swing and lately, we have been so inspired by some social media influence-rs and their Christmas decorations!! We just wanted to share a few of our very favorites and give you some inspiration!

First up is @turtlecreeklane (find her on Instagram). This year she has gone with the full "Who-ville" theme and it is MAGICAL! Jennifer is located in Dallas, Texas and definitely subscribes to the Texas mindset where everything is bigger in Texas. Here are some of my favorite pictures from her Instagram, and it really makes me want to watch every single version of The Grinch!

Next up is Chelsea from @blessed\_ranch on Instagram and this holiday season she has created a beautiful winter wonderland!! Her adorable country style ranch home is very trendy right now, and Chelsea has hit that trend on the nose! Here are some of my favorite posts from her beautiful page!

Last, but certainly not least, is Leslie from @thelesliestyle, also on Instagram! This Christmas season Leslie has gone with very classy, simple (but complex at the same time) Christmas decorations and I am loving it!! It's definitely perfect for the family who doesn't have a ton of time to decorate or likes the more simple and clean look!&nbsp;
