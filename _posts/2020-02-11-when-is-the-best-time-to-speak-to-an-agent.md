Today we’re going to speak to you potential buyers about when the best time is to talk with an agent. Whether you’re considering buying your first home or your fifth, it doesn’t matter. As soon as you begin to think that you want to buy a house, that is the best time to speak with an agent.&nbsp;

What’s the agent going to advise you to do? First, **we’ll encourage you to speak to a lender.** We need to see how you are set up in your ability to buy a home. Is it the best time? What do interest rates look like right now? How is your credit? Do we need to do a few things to improve your credit score?&nbsp;

Next, we’ll perform a needs and wants analysis. We’ll discuss what your needs and wants are. What kind of house do you want to buy? What does the market look like right now? In what area do you want to look? What do you want to avoid?&nbsp;

Then we’ll take a look at your timelines. For example, do you have a lease you need to think about before moving? We need to know what’s going on and what the plan is. Then we can decide what to do from there.&nbsp;
