Lately, we’ve been discussing the home design trends we’ve noticed in the market. Having wrapped up 2018, it’s now time to take a look at what to expect moving further into 2019. According to top decorators and interior designers in the industry, here’s what we might see this year:

**<u>What&rsquo;s &lsquo;In&rsquo;:</u>**

* **Warm modernism.** Many regions throughout the U.S. are choosing a modern aesthetic over the rustic style. While black-and-white contrast and raw materials like steel and wood will continue to be popular, they’ll be softened by color and asymmetry. These modern elements will have a fresh approachability when surrounded by sun-soaked fabrics and natural wallcovering. In short, we’ll continue to see some of those rustic elements, but they’ll be updated with some modern approaches.
* **Industrial style.** Concrete-, quartz-, and metal-lovers rejoice—the industrial style is predicted to rise in popularity in 2019. Matte black and bronze continue to dominate and compliment a more industrial vibe. When selecting wall colors, appliances, faucet finishes, and fabrics, consider all the possibilities of the moody blues and the gray color spectrum. From warm, light grays to the coolness of matte black, these tones add a subtle layer of intrigue and distinction.&nbsp;
* **Bonus Tip:** Black and charcoal gray front doors could boost your curb appeal and earn you a few extra dollars for your home.

**<u>What&rsquo;s &lsquo;Out&rsquo;:</u>**

* **Austere rustic style.** America is finally over the rust, fixer-upper movement. Well, not entirely—as we’ve already discussed, that style will be tempered by a modern approach. We’ll still have some of that farmhouse chic going on, so be sure to keep an eye out for a blend of these styles. We’ll still see things like brushed brass, stainless steel, and matte black, but we’ll move away from the harsh light of the Edison bulb, which will be replaced by the more complementary glow of concealed bulbs.
* **‘Millennial pink.’** Though this was a big color for the 2018 market, bold, trendy color schemes are likely going to work their way out and be replaced with more subtle earth tones and cool, classic palettes. Blues and other neutral colors continue to top Zillow’s trend reports; these colors can help raise the dollar values of home sales when used in the kitchen and bathroom areas. While ‘millennial pink’ may have once been all the rage on home designer Instagram feeds, people are realizing they don’t actually want to live with the color.
