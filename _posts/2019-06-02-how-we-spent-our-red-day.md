Recently, Keller Williams offices around the world celebrated our “RED Day.” This is a day where we shut our doors, put business on hold, and go out into the community and serve our neighbors.&nbsp;

**Here at the Living 48 Real Estate Team, we spent the day helping House of Refuge,** an organization that helps homeless families get back on their feet. They’re not about giving handouts; they’re about giving hand-ups. They have many wonderful programs that grant people the opportunity to improve their lives.

In the video above, I’ve provided some pictures of all the activities we did with House of Refuge. Additionally, I’ve attached a quick clip near the end of Executive Director Nancy Marion talking in-depth about their mission statement. There were over 65 of us there, and we not only logged around 350 hours worth of work, but we also raised $5,000. All in all, it was a huge success.&nbsp;

RED Day is important to me because **I believe we need to give back to the communities we live in, and this is one of the opportunities I have to do so.** House of Refuge, in particular, is important to me because only families with children are eligible for its assistance.&nbsp;

If you’d like to know more about this great organization and what you can do to donate to their cause, you can visit their website **<u><a target="_blank" href="http://houseofrefuge.org/?v=7516fd43adaa">houseofrefuge.org</a></u>**.

If there’s anything we can do to support any of your charities, don’t hesitate to get in touch with us. We’d love to help.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
