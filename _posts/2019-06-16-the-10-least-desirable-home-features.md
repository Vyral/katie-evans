Springtime is here, which means the hottest selling season of the year is finally upon us. To help you understand what the market is looking for, today we’ll be going over 10 home features that homebuyers no longer find desirable:

**1\. Laminate kitchen countertops.** Buyers are expecting granite nowadays, even in lower-priced homes. Some granite is inexpensive, so it may be an update to think about.

**2\. Sunrooms.** Most families see sunrooms as wasted space. And oftentimes, closed-in patios don’t have very good construction quality, so they don’t help to sell your home. Consider updating it or converting it back into a covered patio.

**3\. Whirlpool tubs.** These were all the rage in the ‘80s and ‘90s, but buyers don’t like them anymore. They’re hard to clean and a lot of times, they don’t work properly.&nbsp;

**4\. Carpet on the main level.** Many are not excited about this; they prefer tile, laminate, or hardwood floors on the first level. Go with neutral tones to ensure the floor works with everything else.

**5\. Outdoor kitchens.** Buyers see it as unnecessary and a waste of space. We can simply open up our houses when the weather is nice and utilize the backyard. This may not apply to high-end properties, but you should still think twice before investing money into an outdoor kitchen.

**6\. Two-story family rooms.** People see this as a waste of space. All that ceiling space can be utilized for extra rooms.

**7\. Two-story foyers.** The grand entry isn’t needed—people would rather have the living space.

**8\. Media rooms.** Until recently, home theaters were highly sought after. Now, niche rooms are beginning to lose their popularity, and people are instead opting for family rooms. They’re a lot more versatile.

**9\. Outdoor fireplace.** Because we have so many non-burn days in Arizona, if it’s not gas, you likely won’t utilize it very much. In addition, it costs a lot of money to put them in.

**10\. Community trails.** These used to be must-haves in a community, but now people aren’t as excited about them—especially since they usually have to pay extra for them. If your community is built around these parks and trails, understand that it won’t garner the same attention it used to.

If you have any of these features, you may want to spend a little money to get rid of them. Otherwise, be aware that your home’s saleability and price may be affected.
