<p style="text-align: center;"><em>These four spring cleaning tips give your home some great TLC.</em></p>

Here are four spring cleaning tips that every homeowner can benefit from doing:&nbsp;

**1\. Clean your carpets and floors.** If you have tile floors, now is a fantastic time to bust out the kneepads and get down to cleaning them. If you have carpet, you can still go to places like Home Depot and rent a carpet cleaner to do a DIY cleaning job. Want a professional’s touch? I can refer you to some awesome companies that are taking extra precautions to ensure the safety of their workers and clients; they can come clean your carpets thoroughly, leaving your home looking and feeling fresh.

**2\. Get after those baseboards** Though this may seem like a nitpicky cleaning suggestion, I can attest that when we go into a home for sale, floorboards and baseboards really do catch people’s attention. Here’s my tip: Put the kids to work (you could pay them, but then again they’re living rent-free and eating you out of house and home)—give them an old toothbrush, a cup of soapy water, and a dry, clean rag. They can wet the toothbrush in the water, scrub around the top of those baseboards, then wipe them down with the rag.

**3\. Wipe down your walls.** If your walls are a bit textured like mine, dust can easily collect on them. Grab a rag dampened with soapy water, and wipe them down. Magic erasers are great for tackling scuff marks on doors, but be aware that they’ve been known to cause chipping if used too roughly on painted surfaces. If you’re excited to dive into a little painting project during lockdown, cleaning your walls is the perfect prep work\!

**4\. Clean your blinds.** Can you remember the last time you did this? Take time to wipe down every individual blade and blind. Those collect dust like you wouldn’t believe, and in this high-pollen season, cleaning them will help clear the air in your home and make things easier for your respiratory system.&nbsp;

Not only are these tips great ways to keep busy, but they’re also practical if you plan to sell your home in the near future; getting these more advanced cleaning tasks knocked out now means you’ll have less to stress about later. Remember: Life is for living, and we believe that, more than ever, living begins at home. So do everything you can to make yours beautiful\!&nbsp;
