Here’s how we’re putting your safety first, and employing a little more creativity in our real estate process.

Buyers: Don’t be afraid to purchase a house sight unseen. Believe it or not, countless buyers have been doing this for a very long time. We’ve been leveraging technology to help our out-of-state buyers purchase homes based on virtual walk-throughs for years now, to great effect.

We’ve been using 3D Matterport virtual tours that allow a buyer to virtually enter an accurate rendering of the home. These are just some of the methods we’re focusing on to prioritize the safety of our buyers and sellers amid this coronavirus outbreak. To hear more about how we’ve adapted and how buyers who have entered a contract can protect themselves in these uncertain times, watch the short video above.
