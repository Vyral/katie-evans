Many people think that the holidays are the worst time to sell a house—they want to live in it as a family or they may not want to keep it staged because then they can’t enjoy it. Well, today I’ll share some tips that can help you turn the holiday season into one of the best times of the year to sell your home:

**1\. Watch the seasonality of the market.** The market does change with the seasons, so it’s important to keep an eye on it so we can price your house correctly. Don’t think that there’s not a market during the holidays here in Arizona\! There definitely is, but having a correctly priced home is key if you want to sell it for the most money possible and in good time.

**2\. Do any applicable inspections.** You need to make sure that everything functions the way it’s supposed to so you don’t have to scramble to hire tradespeople during the middle of the holiday season. A lot of them take time off during the holidays. If your home has a leak, for example, you may have to be a little more proactive than at other times of the year. Plus, you don’t want the kitchen to flood in the middle of the holidays while you’re trying to enjoy it with your family. Take care of any of those repairs and be sure to clean up your home to make it sparkle for your showings.

**3\. Decorate for the holidays.** This might come as a surprise to you, but I want you to decorate for all of the holidays—just do it tastefully. This is a wonderful time to showcase how someone else can experience the holidays in your home, so embrace the season\!

**4\. Clean up the exterior of the home.** Even here in Arizona where we don’t get snow, our landscaping changes in the fall and winter. Make sure you have your walkways clean, the lawn trimmed, and spruce your landscaping in general. People want to see how they can enjoy outdoor living in Arizona during the cooler months, so make sure the outside of your home is shown in its best light.

**5\. Prepare your home for showings.** There are so many wonderful scents that go along with the holidays, so embrace the pumpkin spice, cinnamon stick, apples, and other seasonal smells. We want people to walk in and feel like they’re being enveloped by home. Just make sure your home’s scents are uniform throughout the house and that they’re not overwhelming. Additionally, be sure to have all the lights on in the house; since it’s getting darker sooner, it’s important for potential buyers who drive up to see the home as bright and inviting. Plus, a dark home looks smaller, whereas a bright home looks warm and open.
