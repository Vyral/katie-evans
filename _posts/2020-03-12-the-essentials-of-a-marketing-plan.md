If you’re gearing up to sell your home soon, you may think there’s very little you’ll have to do to get it sold quickly. After all, we’re in a strong seller’s market, so you have the upper hand, right? Not necessarily; no matter the market, sellers need to be thinking about these three aspects of marketing to get the most out of their sale:&nbsp;

**1\. Photographs.** Too many agents place their faith in their latest and greatest iPhone or assure clients that the camera equipment at the office will suffice. I’ve got news for them: No, these aren’t the best options, and no, agents can’t provide what a professional photographer can.&nbsp;

Our professional photographers, who are hired at my expense, come out to your listing with a highly specialized camera and take numerous pictures. They use different speeds, apertures, and lightings to ensure optimal exposure. Never forget that your home’s first impression occurs online.&nbsp;

**2\. Pricing your home properly.** There’s a sweet spot we aim for when we go to the market. What are the comparables doing right now? What will the appraiser look at? These are the things you’ll want to discuss in-depth with your listing agent to make sure your home’s price makes sense and attracts the most buyers.&nbsp;

**3\. Cleanliness, staging, and repairs.** The sooner you can get your agent over to walk through the property with you and point out necessary fixes and offer staging ideas, the better. There’s a lot of low-cost, high-return things you can invest your time and money into.&nbsp;

Make sure your agent is going over each of these three aspects with you in detail. Ask them specific follow-up questions for each one. Never settle for subpar service; your home deserves to be sold quickly and for top dollar.&nbsp;
