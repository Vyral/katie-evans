  about_markdown: |
    I joined the Keller Williams East Valley market center in early 2012. I grew up in Mesa, Arizona, where I attended Mountain View High School and graduated in 1993. Later, I attended, and graduated from, Brigham Young University with a B.S. in 1998. I returned to Arizona with my husband, Jason, and daughter, Katelyn, in 1999. Jason and I started a successful custom home electronics business called Components Electronics System, LLC, which we owned and operated for 10 years and sold at the end of 2013. Working in high-end custom and luxury homes with Components solidified my desire to work with home sellers and buyers in the dynamic Arizona real estate market. I specialize in the East Valley cities Mesa, Gilbert, Chandler, Tempe, Queen Creek, and Apache Junction.
